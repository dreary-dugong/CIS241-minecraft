# CIS-241 Final Project: Minecraft Data Mining
For my final project in CIS-241: Intro to Data Mining, I applied data mining techniques to a large database
which recorded player activity on a minecraft server over the period of a few months.

For a digestable overview of what this project included, check the explanatory report in the repors folder.

Data files including the database itself and all derived CSVs were too large to be included in the repo.

If you're interested, you can reach out to me and I will send them to you.
